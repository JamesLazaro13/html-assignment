    <p>Hi! I am James. I am from Ottawa, Ontario. Born to Filipino parents, I identify strongly with my Filipino side.
        I like to spend my free time hiking, camping, with family and creating! and what I mean by creating, I mean
        making art! I am most passionate about photography and videography.
