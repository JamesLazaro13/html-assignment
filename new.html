    </article>
            <p> Hi there! I am James Lazaro, a first-year Algonquin student in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> 
                IMD </abbr> program.
                 I am a first-generation Filipino born in Ottawa, Ontario. My hobbies include photography, videography, 
                 rugby, camping, and working out. I also like to spend my money on bubble tea.
            </p>

              </p>
                
            <p> I am a wedding photographer outside of school and work as a server at a local restaurant in my hometown 
                of Stittsville. I am passionate about digital art. As an individual who works with tech, taking this 
                program will teach me tremendous amounts of information, I can incorporate into art.
             </p>
